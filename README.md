# Computer Architecture

These are the projects I have programmed in my computer architecture and design class. Within this, I learned use of register transfer languages and simulation tools to describe and simulate computer operation; central processing unit organization, input/output and memory system architectures. 

These files add up to the final version of the simple ARMv8 processor implemented using Verilog (single cycle and pipelined)

The list below shows each topic explored in my programmed labs. 

Overview of Computer Architecture

-Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), Representing instructions on the computer, Arithmetical and logical instructions, Memory access instructions

-Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), Control flow instructions, Function calls instructions, Input-output instructions SPIM- instruction set simulator

-Translating and starting a program, Compilers, compiler optimization, Object code generation, assemblers, linking, Run-time execution environment

-Performance evaluation, CPU performance and its factors, performance metrics, performance factors, comparing performance, SPEC benchmarks

-Hardware Description Languages, Verilog hardware description language, Design-Simulation Process, Structural Designs in Verilog Behavioral HDL Description of Systems

-Datapath and Control, and ALU design

-Single-cycle implementation
