# Computer Architecture

This are the projects I have programmed in my computer architecture and design class. Within this, I learned use of register transfer languages and simulation tools to describe and simulate computer operation; central processing unit organization, input/output and memory system architectures. 

These files add up to the final version of the simple ARMv8 processor implemented using Verilog (single cycle and pipelined)

The list below shows the amount of hours spent on each topic explored in my programmed labs. 

3 hours: Overview of Computer Architecture

3 hours: Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), Representing instructions on the computer, Arithmetical and logical instructions, Memory access instructions
